## Overview

### The challenge

This project is a responsive social links profile page, created as a solution to a Frontend Mentor challenge. It displays a my profile image, name, location, bio, and social media links in a simple, dark-themed card layout.

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 for the structure
- CSS3 for styling and layout
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts (Inter) for typography

### What I learned

One unique feature I tried in this project is:

css transform

```.container {
    transform: scale(0.8);
}
```

This scales down the container slightly for laptop screens (applied in @media (min-width: 1024px)) to improve spacing and readability.

### Continued development

- Advanced CSS
- JS
- Typescript
- Git
- React

### Useful resources

- [Transform Property](https://chatgpt.com/share/67c716cd-2b74-8010-809d-de3a9eab6630) - This helped me with resizing for different screen sizes.
